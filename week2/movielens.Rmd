Read data from the `ratings.csv` file
```{r load-data}
ratings <- read_csv('ratings.csv',
                    col_names = c('user_id','movie_id','rating','timestamp'))
```

Loaded `r format(object.size(ratings), units="Mb")` of ratings data, containing `r format(nrow(ratings), big.mark = ",")` ratings. Here's a preview:
```{r preview-data}
head(ratings) %>% kable()

# Summary statistics

# hint: use dplyr's rank and arrange functions, and the base R sum and cumsum functions
# store the result in a new data frame so you can use it in creating figure 2 from the paper below

# Anatomy of the long tail

```{r long-tail}
# generate the equivalent of figure 2 of this paper:
# https://5harad.com/papers/long_tail.pdf

# Specifically, for the subset of users who rated at least 10 movies,
# produce a plot that shows the fraction of users satisfied (vertical
# axis) as a function of inventory size (horizontal axis). We will
# define "satisfied" as follows: an individual user is satisfied p% of
# the time at inventory of size k if at least p% of the movies they
# rated are contained in the top k most popular movies. As in the
# paper, produce one curve for the 100% user satisfaction level and
# another for 90%---do not, however, bother implementing the null
# model (shown in the dashed lines).
